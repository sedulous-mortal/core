## How it works
> Flask serves the static files from React's build folder.
> The send_from_directory function serves the index.html file when the root URL is accessed.
> The static_url_path parameter sets the URL path for static files.
> I may consider using a tool like flask-cors to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) if your React app is running on a different port.

## How To Test The App

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm i`

Installs all the necessary dependencies/node modules for the app to be able to run.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
